The goal of this quiz is to check what you learned on the Introduction to Data Wrangling activity. Don't worry -- your score won't impact your class grade! It will just help us improve how we teach R in STA 112.


# Setup

### R packages

As in the activity, you will need the `tidyverse` package for this quiz. You can load it into R with `library(tidyverse)`. We will also need the `nycflights13` package, which contains the data we will work with. You can load it into R with `library(nycflights13)`.

### Data

In this quiz, we will work with data on flights departing from New York Cityâ€™s three major airports in 2013. Each row in the dataset represents one flight, and the available variables include:

* `year`, `month`, `day`: date of departure
* `dep_time`: departure time
* `arr_time`: arrival time
* `dep_delay`: departure delay (in minutes). Negative times represent early departures
* `arr_delay`: arrival delay (in minutes). Negative times represent early arrivals
* `origin`: the NYC airport the flight departed from (EWR, JFK, or LGA)

This information is contained in the `flights` dataset in the `nycflights13` package.
