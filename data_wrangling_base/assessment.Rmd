## Assessment

Now that you have learned some skills for exploring and summarizing data, let's try them out on new data! **Please answer the three questions (Q1-Q3) about this data in the corresponding boxes below**.

In the following questions, you will work with data on flights departing from New York Cityâ€™s three major airports in 2013. Each row in the dataset represents one flight, and the available variables include:

* `year`, `month`, `day`: date of departure
* `dep_time`: departure time
* `arr_time`: arrival time
* `dep_delay`: departure delay (in minutes). Negative times represent early departures
* `arr_delay`: arrival delay (in minutes). Negative times represent early arrivals
* `origin`: the NYC airport the flight departed from (EWR, JFK, or LGA)

This information is contained in the `flights` dataset.

### Data

Each row in the `flights` dataset represents one flight, and the available variables include:

* `year`, `month`, `day`: date of departure
* `dep_time`: departure time
* `arr_time`: arrival time
* `dep_delay`: departure delay (in minutes). Negative times represent early departures
* `arr_delay`: arrival delay (in minutes). Negative times represent early arrivals
* `origin`: the NYC airport the flight departed from (EWR, JFK, or LGA)

### Question 1

First, let's look for any missing values in the `flights` data. You can explore the dataset using the code space below:

```{r a-q1-code, exercise=TRUE, lines=8}

```

```{r a-q1}
shiny::numericInput(inputId = "q1",
                    value = NA,
                    "Q1: How many rows in the data contain missing values?")
```

### Question 2

Now let's focus on one of the three airports, EWR. You can explore the dataset using the code space below:

```{r a-q2-code, exercise=TRUE, lines=8}

```

```{r a-q2}
shiny::numericInput(inputId = "q2",
                    value = NA,
                    "Q2: How many flights in the data departed from EWR?")
```

### Question 3

Finally, let's calculate a summary statistic. You can explore the dataset using the code space below:

```{r a-q3-code, exercise=TRUE, lines=8}

```

```{r a-q3}
shiny::numericInput(inputId = "q3",
                    value = NA,
                    "Q3: What is the average departure delay for flights departing from EWR? Round your answer to two decimal places. (Remember to deal with missing values before calculating the mean!)")

```

### Question 4

Now that you've had the chance to experiment with R and data exploration, we'd like to hear how you're feeling about the coming semester.


```{r a-q4}
shiny::radioButtons(inputId = "nervous-post",
                   label = "On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = not very nervous, 10 = very nervous), how nervous are you feeling about learning R this semester?", 
                   choices = 1:10,
                   selected = character(0),
                   inline = TRUE)
```
